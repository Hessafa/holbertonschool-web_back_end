# ES6 Basics Project

## Description

This project introduces the fundamental features of **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)**, the 2015 version of JavaScript, which brought significant improvements and modern syntax to the language. Through a series of small tasks, you will practice using new ES6 features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, default parameters, rest/spread syntax, template literals, object shorthand, and more.

This project is part of the **Holberton School Web Back End curriculum**.
